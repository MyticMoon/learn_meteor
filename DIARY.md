I made a big progress in uploading image to S3, it was a really fun process of learning.
Upload to S3 makes it way easier to manage asset files and really cheap solution.
Outstanding to to for image upload:
    - Test image remove
    - Set S3 bucket in a way that it will remove images in tmp folder after 3 days
    - Fine tuning in image upload

Future to-do list:
    - Next thing to tackle:
        + Create filter/search function (I need a working prototype)
    - Continue writing the briefing

I am really looking forward to use this tool in my everyday, it will definitely make an impact and make my intelligence grow.
